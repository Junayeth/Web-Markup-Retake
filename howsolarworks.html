				<h2>Solar Panels</h2>
				</header>
                <p>Solar energy is primarily collected in one of two ways: photovoltaic solar cells 
				and solar thermal. A photovoltaic cell is basically a semi-conductor 
				connected to two electrical contacts. Photons from the sun are absorbed 
				into the semi-conductor (usually a silicon alloy) and knock loose a few 
				electrons. The electrons then travel through the semi-conductor creating 
				an electrical current (3). Solar thermal is a system of giant mirrors 
				that reflect and concentrate the sun's rays to heat a fluid, which 
				produces steam to power a turbine that creates electricity </p>

				<h2>Charge Controller</h2>
				</header>
                <p>The energy from your Solar Panels are in the form of volts, this voltage 
				can fluctuate depending on the amount of sunlight you receive during the 
				day, this can be  detrimental to your battery  if it is  above the battery 
				voltage . When the battery has been charged fully it can no longer store 
				any incoming energy, if the battery voltage gets too high it will rapidly 
				degrade, overheating and become a  fire hazard . Most of the latest 
				charge controllers have overload protection built-in, much like a trip 
				switch, it will protect against any faulty appliances or short circuits.</p>

				<h2>Battery system</h2>
				</header>
                <p>Battery storage systems are emerging as one of the key solutions to effectively 
				integrate high shares of solar and wind renewables in power systems 
				worldwide. A recent analysis from the International Renewable Energy 
				Agency (IRENA) illustrates how electricity storage technologies can be 
				used for a variety of applications in the power sector, from e-mobility 
				and behind-the-meter applications to utility-scale use cases. Utility-scale 
				batteries, for example, can enable a greater feed-in of renewables into 
				the grid by storing excess generation and by firming renewable energy output.</p>

				<h2>DC power</h2>
				</header>
                <p>Thomas Alva Edison and his team developed the DC generator, circuit breaker 
				equipment, fuses, bulbs, and the first DC systems in 1881. The DC systems 
				operated with 110 volts as small isolated systems to decrease power 
				losses. Several years later (in 1887), George Westinghouse bought Tesla’s 
				patents related to AC systems and employed him to continue its development.</p>

				<h2>Inverter</h2>
				</header>
                <p>The inverter is one of the most important and most complex components in
				an independent energy system. To choose an inverter, you don’t have to understand 
				its inner workings, but you should know some basic functions, capabilities, and 
				limitations. This article gives you some of the information you’ll need to 
				choose the right inverter and use it wisely. Why You Need an Inverter Independent 
				electric energy systems are untethered from the electrical utility grid. They vary 
				in size from tiny yard lights to remote homes, villages, parks, and medical and 
				military facilities. They also include mobile, portable, and emergency backup 
				systems. Their common bond is the storage battery, which absorbs and releases 
				energy in the form of direct current (DC) electricity.</p>

				<h2>AC power</h2>

				<section class="paragraph">
                <p>An alternating current will flip the direction of charge flow (60 times a second 
				in North America (60 Hz) and 50 times a second in Europe (50 Hz)). This is usually 
				caused by a sinusoidally varying current and voltage that reverses directions, 
				creating a periodic back and forth motion for the current. Despite this current 
				flowing back and forth many times a second, the energy still essentially flows 
				continuously from the power plant to the electronic devices.</p>
